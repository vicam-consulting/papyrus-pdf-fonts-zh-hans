# PapyrusPDF Simplified Chinese fonts

Optional static Noto Sans SC and Noto Serif SC Regular, distributed at no
charge. Fonts are SIL OFL 1.1; the existing PHP package licence remains unchanged.

```sh
composer require vicam/papyrus-pdf-fonts-zh-hans
```

Requires PHP 8.3+ and PapyrusPDF ^0.3.4. `PdfEngineFactory` discovers this pack
alongside any other installed language packs. Source and caller fonts retain
priority; regional and style hints choose these files only for missing glyphs.
Unknown shared Han is ambiguous; installing one pack does not assume a language.
Japanese requests never use Chinese glyph shapes. Regular only; no synthetic bold
or italic.

Disable discovery with `new PdfEngineFactory(discoverFormFonts: false)` or supply
`formFallbacks: \PapyrusPDF\FontsZhHans\NotoZhHans::formFallbacks()` explicitly.
For overlays, use `new OverlayFontFile(NotoZhHans::path(NotoZhHans::SANS))` from the
`PapyrusPDF\Papyrus\Overlay` namespace and put it in your fallback list.

See [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md), [font licence](fonts/OFL.txt) and
[Serif licence](fonts/OFL-Serif.txt). Run `composer test` after installing development
dependencies. The library parses fonts in PHP; building instances is development only.
